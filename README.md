Project Description

This is a mini PHP project built without object-oriented programming (OOP). It uses AJAX for asynchronous operations and the Leaflet.js library to display an interactive map.

Features
Users can select and submit their desired locations directly on the map.

Submitted locations are pending admin approval. After approval, they are displayed as pins on the map.

A "My Location" button allows users to quickly locate and display their current position on the map.

Technologies Used

JavaScript (AJAX)

Leaflet.js (interactive maps)
